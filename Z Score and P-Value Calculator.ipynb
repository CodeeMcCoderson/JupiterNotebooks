That is, when you have a specific direction in mind. For instance, you might want to test whether a new web page design leads to more clicks than the old design (i.e., \"greater than\"), or if a new medicine lowers blood pressure more than the standard medicine (i.e., \"less than\"). The critical region (where we would reject the null hypothesis) is only in one tail of the distribution.\n",
